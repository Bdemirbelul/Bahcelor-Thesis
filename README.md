# Bahcelor-Thesis 
Overview:
This repository contains a detailed implementation of the concept of physics, using structured JSON format. It aims to provide a comprehensive educational tool for students, educators, and physics enthusiasts to better understand and calculate potential energy across various scenarios, including gravitational, elastic, and electrostatic potential energy. This code structure helps in visualizing key concepts, formulas, examples, and provides detailed explanations about each type of potential energy.

Features:
Detailed Descriptions: Includes both short and long descriptions to help explain the theory of potential energy in simple terms as well as more advanced language.
Formulas and Examples: Provides relevant formulas for different forms of potential energy and practical examples to illustrate these formulas in real-world contexts.
Questions and Answers: Includes frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers to enhance understanding and encourage deeper learning.
Educational Tool: Aimed at students learning physics, this tool can be used as a reference guide for homework, tests, or as a general resource for physics concepts.
Key Elements:
Small Descriptions: Short, clear, and to-the-point explanations about potential energy.
Long Descriptions: In-depth explanations, breaking down the principles of potential energy into sub-categories (e.g., gravitational, elastic, and electrostatic potential energy). These give the user a comprehensive understanding.
Formulas: Provides standard formulas for calculating potential energy (e.g., Gravitational Potential Energy formula U = mgh).
Examples: Real-life examples of potential energy in action, including objects like springs, water dams, or charged particles.
Questions and Answers: Frequently asked questions that help reinforce the concepts. The user can ask questions like "What is potential energy?", "Formula of potential energy?", and "Ask a question about potential energy?" to quickly find answers.
Hints: Offer tips for students on how to think about potential energy in terms of forces, height, mass, and position.
