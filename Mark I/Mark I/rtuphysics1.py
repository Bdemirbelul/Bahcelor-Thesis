            "Potential energy refers to the stored energy in an object or system due to its position or configuration. It is not directly observable, but it can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy when the object is allowed to move. One of the most common examples is gravitational potential energy, which is associated with the position of an object relative to a reference point, typically the ground.",
            "Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is determined by the mass of an object, the height above a reference point, and the force of gravity acting on the object. The formula to calculate GPE is U = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational acceleration (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth), and h is the height above the reference point. As the height of the object increases, its potential energy increases, allowing it to do more work when it falls.",
            "Elastic potential energy is stored in objects that can be deformed, such as springs or rubber bands. The more a spring is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium position, the more elastic potential energy it stores. This energy can be calculated using Hooke’s Law, where the force required to compress or stretch a spring is proportional to the displacement from its resting position.",
            "Electrostatic potential energy is associated with the interaction between charged particles. When two charged particles are near each other, the force of attraction or repulsion depends on their charges and the distance between them. Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract, creating potential energy in the system. This type of potential energy is governed by Coulomb’s Law, which states that the electrostatic force between two point charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",
            "Chemical potential energy is another form of potential energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. This energy is released during chemical reactions when bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. For example, in a combustion reaction, the chemical potential energy in fuel is released as heat and light. The amount of energy stored in a substance is determined by the strength of the bonds between atoms and molecules.",
            "In all cases, potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy when the object or system is allowed to change its position or configuration. For example, when an object is dropped, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the object accelerates towards the ground. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) in a closed system remains constant, as described by the law of conservation of mechanical energy.",
            "Potential energy also plays a crucial role in many natural processes. For example, the potential energy of water stored in a dam can be converted into kinetic energy to generate electricity. Similarly, potential energy stored in food is released during metabolism, providing energy for the body to perform work. The conversion of potential energy to other forms of energy is fundamental to many physical, biological, and engineering systems."
